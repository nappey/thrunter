## Executive Summary

This report documents the completion of the "This is a Test" threat hunt, conducted as part of our proactive threat hunting program. The hunt was initiated on 2025-08-09 and completed on 2025-08-12.

## Hunt Details

### Original Hunt Request Information

The following information was extracted from the original GitHub issue:

```
### Hunt Name

Powershell execution patterns

### Hunt Priority

Medium (Proactive monitoring improvement)

### Baseline Hunt Type

Temporal Baseline (time-based activity patterns)

User Role (executives, admins, general users)

### Detailed Scope Definition

All windows machines

### Temporal Baseline Scope

- [ ] Last 7 days (recent short-term patterns)
- [x] Last 30 days (monthly patterns)
- [ ] Last 90 days (quarterly patterns)
- [ ] Last 6 months (seasonal variations)
- [ ] Last 12 months (annual cycles)
- [ ] Business hours only (8 AM - 6 PM)
- [ ] After hours activity (6 PM - 8 AM)
- [ ] Weekend patterns
- [ ] Holiday/special event periods

### Expected Normal Patterns

Lots of data

### Required Data Sources for Baseline

- [ ] Windows Security Event Logs (4624, 4625, 4648, etc.)
- [ ] Sysmon logs (process creation, network, file)
- [ ] PowerShell operational/script block logs

### Statistical Analysis Approach

Outlier Detection (statistical anomalies)

### Baseline Analysis Methodology

Here are the plans for execution

### Key Baseline Metrics

Different numbers

### Normal Range Definitions

No clue

### Analysis Techniques

- [ ] Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range)
- [x] Time series decomposition (trend, seasonal, residual)
- [ ] Moving averages (smoothing short-term fluctuations)
- [ ] Percentile analysis (95th, 99th percentile thresholds)
- [ ] Correlation analysis (relationships between variables)
- [ ] Clustering analysis (grouping similar behaviors)
- [ ] Anomaly scoring (statistical deviation measures)
- [ ] Control charts (process control limits)

### Anomaly Detection Sensitivity

Low (only major anomalies - low false positives)

### Baseline Validation Process

Will use methods

### Response Actions for Detected Anomalies

- [ ] Automated alerting (immediate notification)
- [ ] Manual investigation (analyst review)
- [x] Business context validation (check for planned activities)
- [ ] Extended monitoring (watch for patterns)
- [ ] Stakeholder notification (inform asset owners)
- [ ] Incident escalation (if malicious activity suspected)
- [ ] Baseline refinement (adjust thresholds if needed)
- [ ] Documentation update (record new normal patterns)

### Threshold Tuning Strategy

Initial tuning

### Baseline Documentation Deliverables

- [x] Baseline behavior profile (normal patterns document)
- [ ] Statistical analysis report (metrics and thresholds)
- [ ] Anomaly detection playbook (response procedures)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard (real-time baseline tracking)
- [ ] Alert tuning guide (threshold adjustment procedures)
- [ ] Business context documentation (known variations)
- [ ] Technical implementation guide (query/rule documentation)
- [ ] Executive summary (business value and risk reduction)

### Ongoing Baseline Monitoring Plan

Yup

### Expected Detection Improvements

- [x] Reduced false positive rates (better normal definitions)
- [ ] Earlier threat detection (catch smaller deviations)
- [ ] Improved alert prioritization (confidence scoring)
- [ ] Better incident context (normal vs. abnormal comparison)
- [ ] Enhanced threat hunting (know what to look for)
- [ ] Automated anomaly detection (statistical rules)
- [ ] Business-aligned security (operationally relevant alerts)
- [ ] Measurable security posture (quantified normal state)

### Knowledge Sharing Strategy

Yup

### Baseline Hunt Success Criteria

Yup

### Estimated Baseline Hunt Duration

Ongoing baseline development (multi-month project)

### Data Quality Requirements

Yup

### Business Context & Environmental Factors

Yup

### Baseline Hunt Readiness Checklist

- [x] Baseline scope clearly defined and validated
- [x] Required data sources confirmed available and complete
- [x] Statistical analysis approach selected and documented
- [x] Business context factors identified and documented
- [x] Success criteria and quality standards defined
